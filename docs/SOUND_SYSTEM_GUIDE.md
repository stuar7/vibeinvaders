## How to Set Up Sounds

1. Create a `public/sounds/` directory in your project
2. Download sound files from the free resources below
3. Rename them to match the expected filenames (see Sound File List)
4. The game will automatically load any sounds it finds

   - `explosion_medium.mp3` (general explosion)
   - `impact_small.mp3` (hit feedback)
   - `powerup_collect.mp3` (collection feedback)

2. **Add variety:**
   - Different weapon sounds for each weapon type
   - Multiple explosion variations
   - UI feedback sounds

3. **Polish with ambience:**
   - Background music/ambience
   - Special effect sounds

## Integration in Game

The sound system is already integrated. To use it in your components:

```javascript
import { useGameSounds } from '../hooks/useGameSounds';

function MyComponent() {
  const { playSound, playWeaponSound, setVolume } = useGameSounds();
  
  // Play a specific sound
  playSound('explosion_large');
  
  // Play weapon sound
  playWeaponSound('rocket');
  
  // Adjust volume (0-1)
  setVolume(0.8);
}
```

## Volume Guidelines

Default volume levels are set for balance:
- Weapon sounds: 0.4-0.8
- Impact sounds: 0.3-0.5
- Explosions: 0.6-0.8
- UI sounds: 0.2-0.5
- Ambient: 0.1-0.2

## Testing Without Sounds

The game is designed to work perfectly without any sound files. You can:
1. Run the game without any sounds - it will log missing files once but continue normally
2. Add sounds incrementally as you download them
3. Test with partial sound sets

## File Format Support

The system supports:
- MP3 (recommended for compatibility)
- WAV (larger files but lossless)
- OGG (good compression, check browser support)

## Tips for Sound Selection

1. **Keep files small** - Aim for under 100KB per sound effect
2. **Match the aesthetic** - Retro arcade sounds work great for this style
3. **Use variations** - Multiple similar sounds prevent repetition
4. **Test volume levels** - Ensure sounds are balanced
5. **Consider loops** - Ambient sounds should loop seamlessly

## Troubleshooting

- **No sounds playing:** Check browser console for initialization - sounds require user interaction first
- **Sounds too loud/quiet:** Adjust master volume with `setVolume()`
- **Missing sound spam:** Each missing sound is logged only once
- **Performance issues:** Reduce concurrent sounds or disable less important ones

The sound system enhances gameplay but never interferes with it. Enjoy creating your audio experience!
