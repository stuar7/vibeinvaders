## Quick Testing

1. Start with just 3-4 sounds to test the system
2. The game will work fine with missing sounds
3. Check browser console for "Sound loaded" messages
4. Use the sound settings in Options to test

## Recommended First Downloads

For a minimal but effective sound set, prioritize:

1. `laser_basic.mp3` - Main weapon sound
2. `explosion_medium.mp3` - General explosion
3. `powerup_collect.mp3` - Feedback for collections
4. `game_over.mp3` - Game over notification

## File Size Tips

- Keep sound effects under 50KB each
- Use MP3 format for best compatibility
- Trim silence from beginning/end
- Use mono instead of stereo for smaller files

## Volume Balancing

The game automatically balances volumes, but you can fine-tune in `SoundManager.js` if needed:
- Weapon sounds: 40-80% volume
- Explosions: 60-80% volume  
- UI sounds: 20-50% volume
- Ambient: 10-20% volume

Remember: The game works perfectly without any sounds, so add them incrementally!
